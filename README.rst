Microsoft Azure CLI Dev Tools (azdev)
=====================================

The ``azdev`` tool is designed to aid new and experienced developers in contributing to Azure CLI command modules and extensions.

Setting up your development environment
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1. Install Python 3.6+ from http://python.org. Please note that the version of Python that comes preinstalled on OSX is 2.7.

2. Fork and clone the repository or repositories you wish to develop for.
    - For Azure CLI: https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli
    - For Azure CLI Extensions: https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli-extensions
    - Any other repository that you might have access to that contains CLI extensions.

3. Create a new virtual environment for Python in the root of your clone. You can do this by running:

    Python 3.6+ (all platforms):

    ::

        python -m venv env

    or:

    ::

        python3 -m venv env


4. Activate the env virtual environment by running:

    Windows CMD.exe:

    ::

        env\scripts\activate.bat

    Windows Powershell:

    ::

        env\scripts\activate.ps1


    OSX/Linux (bash):

    ::

        source env/bin/activate

5. Install ``azdev`` by running:

    ::

        pip install azdev

6. Complete setup by running:

    ::

        azdev setup


    This will launch the interactive setup process. To see non-interactive options run `azdev setup -h`.
